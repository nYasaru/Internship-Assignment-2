                        <p>At xolve branding, I was Hired as a UI/UX Designer. I was tasked, alongside my teammate, Khue (s375xxxx), to create the online prescence for the company’s subsidary, Bean Design Studio. <br><br>
                            During the first stages we focused on User Experiences, Sitemapping and helped tune into the Target Audience. As we were beginning to move on with the project, COVID made it so that we had to work from home. </p>

                            I ended up learning about Wordpress Development, and it only came about through a lot of ups and downs and many many attempts. This Website acts as a report of my experience and to help paint a better picture of my internship.</p>

                            <p>A principle I learned from my time during video production classes was the 5 step production timeline (As opposed to the 3 step of Pre/Production/Post.) I think as designers or even as creatives it can act as a strong benchmark for planning. From my experience on UI/UX projects, it never starts with a wireframe. <br><br>

                                The idea is that you can apply these 5 steps to almost any creative process and break it down to give yourself and/or your team a roadmap of how to get to the finish line. It helps break down herculean tasks into easier to digest pieces.

                            <p>The first few steps are an opportunity to figure out the scope of the project, which skills will you need to learn, what are the limits of experimentation of the brief, how well is the brief defined? And the other stages offer a sense of structure to a seemingly subjective part of the work, the actual design process.   <br> <br>

                                The final stage helps with contextualizing the value this work may have, what are the end goals for this and being able to have even a rough outline of what that may be helps. </p>

                        <p data-scroll data-scroll-class="fadein" class="faded" style="width: 40%; padding-top: 2em;">What started out with the intention of being an internship where I would work on many projects and learn as much as I can, be able to show my true colours, have a wonderful time in a well-renowned office being surrounded by super talented teammates and co-workers, ended up becoming a work from home job and arguably one of my challenging experiences as a designer. <br> <br>

                            Even still, it was an opportunity for me to come face to face with something I struggled with. The idea of failing had been something I was deathly afraid of, but this experience showed me that, if you want to get to something good you might just have to fail your way there. My stay at xolve taught me how I could make sure that by following proper procedures and by being professional. One can create an environment where it is safe to fail and to learn from that. <br> <br>
                            
                            Overall it was an incredibly educational experience and I am glad I got to experience it regardless of the limitations placed on the experience due to COVID.  Below I’ve listed a few key points from my internship.

All I can say a core aspect about becoming a specialist comes from perspective. When you know what you do not know you can become better and what better way to do that than learn from everything around you. Old uncle Iroh explains it better than I do.
